# JavaScript Capstone Project: FlappyBird

> This project meant to be a platform game, based on the requirements giving to me, and it supposed to be delivered in 5 days as a max, there are a lot of platform games out there starting from the famous game of the nighties Super Mario, I decided to build the FlappyBird game because, to be honest, I was always fascinated by it and in the same time, I was frustrated how it was hard so the first thought that comes to my mind when I heard building a game I thought of building a new and easier version of the FlappyBird.
